# Sticky Notes

### Project Description:

This is a project I created using a YouTube tutorial from 'dcode'. It involved using HTML, Javascript, and CSS to create a sticky notes application.

### Features:

Sticky notes can be used to keep reminder notes. You can add, edit, and delete notes. Notes are displayed in a grid format.

### How to use:

The page can be viewed using the HTML index file.

Notes can be added using the + button.

Clicking on a note allows you to edit the text. Clicking away from the note then saves the edit.

Double clicking a note brings up the option to delete the note.



### Technologies:

Basic use of HTML to structure the page. CSS was used for styling. Javascript to create the functionality.

### Licence

Open.
